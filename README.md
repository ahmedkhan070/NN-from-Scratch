# Neural Network from Scratch Using NumPy

This Jupyter notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building a neural network from scratch using only NumPy and the math library. The notebook follows the concepts and techniques demonstrated in the [YouTube playlist on Neural Networks from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3).

## Overview

In this notebook, you'll learn how to:

1. **Understand the Basics of Neural Networks**: Learn about the fundamental components of a neural network, including neurons, layers, activation functions, and backpropagation.

2. **Build a Neural Network from Scratch**: Implement a simple neural network architecture using only NumPy and basic math operations.

3. **Train the Neural Network**: Develop and apply the training algorithm, including forward propagation and backpropagation, to optimize the network's weights.

4. **Evaluate the Performance**: Test the performance of the neural network on sample data and visualize the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Math library

You can install NumPy using pip if it is not already installed:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Notebook Structure

1. **Introduction**: Overview of neural networks and the goals of this notebook.
2. **Data Preparation**: Generate or load sample data for training and testing.
3. **Neural Network Architecture**: Define the structure of the neural network, including the number of layers and neurons.
4. **Forward Propagation**: Implement the forward propagation step to compute the output of the network.
5. **Loss Function**: Define the loss function to evaluate the performance of the network.
6. **Backpropagation**: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to update the network's weights.
7. **Training**: Train the neural network on the sample data.
8. **Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the network and visualize the results.

## How to Use
